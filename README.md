Requirements:
Autoit - https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

Awakened POE Trade - https://github.com/SnosMe/awakened-poe-trade

Path of exile for Steam in GFN

Features:
- No need to change Awakened PoE Trade settings
- Copy Item Details in background
- Setup Wizard
- Auto Start awakened PoE Trade
- more to come

Install:
1. Create a docs.google.com document and share it to everyone so it shows /edit at the end in URL.
2. Change default Website in Steam overlay to the docs.google.com URL .
3. Set Steam overlay default key to F7
4. You dont need to change settings in Awakened PoE Trade anymore. If you changed the Window title then please revert back to "Path of Exile"
5. Run script. 
   The first price check after running the script takes 10 sek because the docs.google.com takes some time to be loaded inside gfn  

Usage:


F5 = Goto hideout 

F6 = price check (hover mouse over the item) 

F7 = open steam overlay (not needed for this script) 

F9 = Respond to last whisper with thanks 

F11 = force close script
