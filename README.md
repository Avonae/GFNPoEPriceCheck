Install:
1. Create a docs.google.com document and share it to everyone so it shows /edit at the end in URL.
2. Change default Website in Steam overlay to the docs.google.com URL .
3. Set Steam overlay default key to F7
4. You dont need to change settings in Awakened PoE Trade anymore. If you changed the Window title then please revert back to "Path of Exile"
5. Run script. 
   The first price check after running the script takes 10 sek because the docs.google.com takes some time to be loaded inside gfn
